** What is this?

These repositories (all of those under the V128Team github team) comprise the
operating system, schematics, hardware designs, and materials to create what
amounts to a Commodore 128Dcr *mini*.

** How do I check this out?

First, you'll need to install a copy of Android's `repo` tool. Once you've done
that, do the following:

  : host:~$ mkdir v128
  : host:~$ cd v128
  : host:~/v128$ repo init -u https://github.com/V128Team/
  : # ... answer any prompts ...
  : host:~/v128$ repo sync

That will pull down the source code. From there, do this:

  : host:~/v128$ source build/setup.sh
  : host:~/v128$ m prereqs
  : host:~/v128$ m rootfs

The first target, ~prereqs~, will ~apt-get install~ all the dependencies needed
to build a filesystem image and run the simulation of the system.

From there, the second target will actually build all of the artifacts. They
will be placed in the ~out/~ directory. Aside from these, there are other
targets available -- all written as ~.PHONY~ targets in the makefiles in the
~build/~ directory.

Once it's built, you can run the simulator using the `simulate` target.
