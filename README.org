** What is this?

These repositories (all of those under the V128Team github team) comprise the
operating system, schematics, hardware designs, and materials to create what
amounts to a Commodore 128Dcr *mini*.

** How do I check this out?

First, you'll need to install a copy of Android's `repo` tool. Once you've done
that, do the following:

  : mkdir v128
  : cd v128
  : repo init -u https://github.com/V128Team/
  : # ... answer any prompts ...
  : repo sync

That will pull down the source code. From there, do this:

  : source build/setup.sh
  : m prereqs
  : m rootfs

The first target, `prereqs`, will `apt-get install` all the dependencies needed
to build a filesystem image and run the simulation of the system.

From there, the second target will actually build all of the artifacts. They
will be placed in the `out/` directory. Aside from these, there are other
targets available -- all written as .PHONY targets in the makefiles in the
`build/` directory.

Once it's built, you can run the simulator using the `simulate` target.
